# Coding Challenges

This project contains Python scripts that implement various functions related to stacks, sequences (lists/tuples), and dictionaries

## Stacks

Implement a function is_balanced(expression) that takes a string containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, and determines whether the expression is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

## Sequences (Lists/Tuples)

Write a function remove_duplicates(sequence) that takes a sequence (list or tuple) and returns a new sequence with duplicates removed while maintaining the original order of elements.

## Dictionaries

Implement a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the sentence. Ignore punctuation and consider words in a case-insensitive manner.
